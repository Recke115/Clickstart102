        <h2>Our mission!</h2>
        <p>Wildlife Defenders works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.Wildlife Defenders connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1.3 million supporters in the United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.
Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but itâ€™s also humans who have the power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.</p>
